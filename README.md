# Analyzing-Zomato-Ratings-Across-Bangalore


Project Duration: September 2024

Overview: Conducted a detailed analysis of a dataset containing information on 51,717 restaurants in Bangalore, leveraging Python and data manipulation libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The project aimed to derive insights into restaurant performance based on ratings, online ordering availability, and other key metrics.

Key Achievements:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Removed null values in critical columns, reducing the dataset to 23,259 entries for analysis.
Standardized categorical data, enhancing data integrity for model building.
Descriptive Statistics:

Analyzed restaurant ratings, revealing an average rating of 3.91 out of 5, with a notable maximum vote count of 16,832 for popular establishments.
Identified that 58.8% of restaurants offer online ordering, while 12.9% provide table booking facilities.
Visualization:

Created insightful visualizations to represent data distributions, such as the top cuisines and restaurant types, aiding in a clear understanding of market trends.
Predictive Modeling:

Developed multiple regression models to predict restaurant ratings based on features like average cost, location, and restaurant type.
Achieved an impressive accuracy of 91.03% using a Random Forest Regressor, outperforming other models (Linear Regression and Lasso) significantly.
Insights Derived:

Determined that the most common restaurant type was "Quick Bites" (37% of entries) and the average cost for two people predominantly ranged between ₹300 to ₹800.
Explored correlations between customer ratings and online ordering, providing actionable insights for restaurant owners to enhance their service offerings.
Tools & Technologies Used:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
Impact: This project not only honed my data analysis and machine learning skills but also provided valuable insights that can guide restaurant strategies in a competitive market. The findings could assist stakeholders in decision-making, enhancing customer satisfaction, and optimizing operational strategies.
